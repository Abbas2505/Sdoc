This guide will help you understand how to use the application effectively. Introduction Thank you for choosing our smart energy-saving solution. With this system, users take the lead in managing energy use more efficiently and sustainably. By installing the compact hardware in the home, office, mall, or godowns, users unlock the power of real-time monitoring and intelligent insights\u2014all through a simple mobile app. As soon as users connect to the device, the app begins tracking energy consumption. From there, it guides with personalized suggestions, helping users make smart choices that reduce bills and environmental impact. Whether users are at home or on the go, they stay in control because saving energy is easy, effective, and empowering. Audience Users who install the hardware at home or in a facility to better understand and manage energy usage. This guide is designed for users like houseowners, facility managers, or energy-conscious individuals who want to follow clear steps to check consumption and track savings on utility bills. Purpose of User Guide This guide helps users take full advantage of sustainable savings systems: Explore user savings details confidently and understand how energy affects the costs. Enter the right information after installing the Figma Hardware to calculate user\u2019s savings accurately in the mobile app. View user energy usage through dynamic graphs that clearly show the difference between before and after installation of Figma Hardware. Style Guide To make this guide easy for users to read and use, we follow the Microsoft Style Guide. Since the project didn\u2019t specify a particular style, we chose one that focuses on clarity, simplicity, and a helpful tone. Input for User Guide After the project started, the client team set up a call to explain the goals and expectations of the project.
